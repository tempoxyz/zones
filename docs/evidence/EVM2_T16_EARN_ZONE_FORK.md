# T16 native Earn and Zone fork smoke test

The [checked record](evm2-t16-native-earn-zone-smoke.json) captures one disposable
Tempo L1 and Zone devnet. Tempo source `2ed378214` used the binary SHA-256 in
the record; Zones source `c494eca38` used the separately recorded binary. The
L1 began with T15 at Unix time `1790921148` and T16 at `1790922288`. Its
pre-fork EarnVault had 1,000,000 EarnShare and 1,000,000 pathUSD of venue
backing. A pre-fork Zone deposit held another 100,000 pathUSD in its L1 portal,
with 100,000 private supply. The Zone was created before L1 T16 and kept the
same datadir and genesis block across the L1 boundary.

The legacy EarnFactory does not index all deployed vaults. For this devnet,
the stack was reconciled at L1 block 439 using Tempo's
[`build-native-earn-manifest.py`](https://github.com/tempoxyz/tempo/blob/dan/evm2-native-payments/scripts/native-payments/build-native-earn-manifest.py).
Its [EIP-1186 account and storage proofs](evm2-t16-native-earn-manifest-proof.json)
were verified against that block's state root, including the manifest's code
hashes, vault/fee bindings, and the vault's EarnShare issuer role. Six account
proofs and nine storage proofs bind the role to the same manifest vault. The
generated `nativeEarnManifest` was inserted
into the local genesis configuration and the node restarted before T16. This
configuration step is a devnet procedure; a production activation needs a
published, fixed manifest and commitment before the fork. These are state
proofs, not a cryptographic Zone execution proof.

At L1 block 1171 the EarnVault still had its legacy proxy code hash. Block
1172, timestamp `1790922288`, replaced the vault and EarnFees clone code with
the pinned dispatcher hash while retaining both accounts' storage. EarnShare
supply, vault assets, venue assets, and portal backing were identical at
blocks 1171 and 1172. A restarted Zone batch submitter initially failed
because its older Tempo SDK could not parse the L1's new `T16` label.
[The Zones fix](https://github.com/tempoxyz/zones/pull/1637) reads T13 activation
from the fork schedule and resumed queued batches on the same datadir. The
Zone's own T15 was then scheduled for Unix time `1790922875`, after which
signed private transfers succeeded.

The isolated post-fork Earn transactions were:

| Call | L1 block | Receipt | Payment gas | General gas | Accounting result |
| --- | ---: | --- | ---: | ---: | --- |
| `spendFromEarn(400000, …)` | 1193 | success | 222,094 | 0 | shares and venue assets 1,000,000 → 600,000; recipient +400,000 |
| `deposit(200000, 200000)` | 1230 | success | 262,432 | 0 | shares and venue assets 600,000 → 800,000 |
| venue yield transfer of 100,000 | 1250 | success | 39,942 | 0 | assets 800,000 → 900,000; shares stay 800,000 |
| `redeem(100000, 112500)` | 1267 | success | 218,144 | 0 | shares 800,000 → 700,000; assets 900,000 → 787,500 |
| `redeem(10000, 1000000)` | 1285 | revert | 457,558 | 0 | shares and custody unchanged |

The spend trace contains a native vault delegate frame, a nested native
EarnFees delegate frame, TIP-20 burn/transfer calls, and the engine and venue
exit. The metric samples in the record match each single-transaction block by
timestamp and exact receipt gas. A post-fork Zone private transfer in L2 block
1418 moved another 10,000 units: the sender held 80,000, the recipient 20,000,
private supply remained 100,000, and L1 portal backing remained 100,000. The
batch covering that transfer settled in L1 block 2554 with 98,842 payment gas
and zero general gas. It used explicit NoProof mode and does **not**
demonstrate Nitro execution-proof validity.

A separate contract at `0x8464135c8F25Da09e49BC8782676a84730C318bC` had
the exact dispatcher runtime hash but no system registration. Its
`spendFromEarn` call reverted with no child calls in L1 block 3981. That block
also included a real Earn redemption: the matched metric charged 1,000,000
general gas to the forged call and 218,120 payment gas to the registered
payment. Matching bytecode and selector alone therefore did not grant payment
capacity in this run.

The [30-minute mixed-load record](evm2-t16-mixed-load-summary.json) contains
[450 complete cycles](evm2-t16-mixed-load-30m.jsonl.gz): 900 Earn
deposits/redemptions and 450 private Zone transfers, with 18 unchanged custody
checkpoints. [Sampled lane counters](evm2-t16-mixed-load-lane-metrics.jsonl.gz)
match all 900 Earn blocks. General gas was zero in 898; the other two blocks
included separate forged-dispatcher deployment/call transactions, while their
payment gas exactly covered the Earn receipts. The last private transfer was
in Zone block 4353. The batch through block 4360 was submitted to L1, with
successful settlement receipt
`0x21baa9efd6ac2817bf2f659cca8c659e282b1ac3cb29d55e8ea1454f04576038`
in L1 block 5434. The serial workload averaged 0.25 mixed cycles per second;
it measures sustained correctness, not maximum capacity. Its settlement was
still in NoProof mode. The Tempo PR includes the
[`summarize-t16-mixed-load.py`](https://github.com/tempoxyz/tempo/blob/dan/evm2-native-payments/scripts/native-payments/summarize-t16-mixed-load.py)
checker for the compressed raw data.

The [reviewed-binary fork record](evm2-t16-reviewed-fork.json) captures a
second branch copied at the common pre-fork L1 block 1171. Its next block
activated T16 with the reviewed Tempo binary, retaining 1,000,000 EarnShare
and vault/venue assets. On this branch, Earn deposit, redemption, and spending
and a new Zone 2 portal deposit all used payment gas with zero general gas.
Zone 2 moved 1,000 of its 10,000 private pathUSD from sender to recipient;
its covering batch settled on L1 in receipt
`0x90a55796e214a661fc65d07df519e5ae52650ae77013703d09ad48b0fd88fd80`
with 98,026 payment gas and zero general gas. Authenticated private balances
and supply matched L1 portal backing. The Tempo PR's
[`check-t16-reviewed.py`](https://github.com/tempoxyz/tempo/blob/dan/evm2-native-payments/scripts/native-payments/check-t16-reviewed.py)
rechecks these receipts, fork code hashes, balances, and lane samples against
the running reviewed L1 and Zone. The new Zone still uses NoProof mode.

While these isolated devnets are available, rerun the public receipt and state
checker from the Tempo checkout:

```bash
python3 scripts/native-payments/check-t16-combined.py
cargo run --quiet -p tempo-evm --example verify_native_earn_proofs -- \
  docs/evidence/evm2-t16-native-earn-manifest-proof.json
```

For private Zone balance verification, set `EVM2_ZONE_SENDER_KEY` and
`EVM2_ZONE_RECIPIENT_KEY` to the two disposable devnet signers before running
the checker. It derives short-lived authenticated RPC tokens locally and reads
the historical L2 state at block 1418. The checked run verified 12 L1
accounting snapshots, six Earn receipts, the fork code transition, two Zone
private transfers, portal backing, and the zero-general-lane settlement sample.
