//! Dynamic role supervision for multi-sequencer zone nodes.
//!
//! The [`RoleController`] switches complete role generations — block production or import,
//! broadcast, transaction flow, settlement, and sequencer background tasks — as one fenced
//! unit, driven by the effective [`LeadershipSchedule`].
//!
//! The control rule is about the **next anchor**, never the last applied one: for the next
//! Tempo anchor `N` to be consumed, if `schedule.leader_for(N)` is this node and the zone
//! block embedding `N − 1` is locally canonical, the controller runs the leader generation
//! and the engine produces `N`; otherwise it runs the follower generation and imports. The
//! per-anchor [`ProductionPermit`](crate::ProductionPermit) inside the engine and the
//! anchor-aware sender fence inside follower import are the protocol fences; generation
//! switching is lifecycle management.
