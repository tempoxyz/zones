//! Zero-downtime leadership handoff e2e tests.
//!
//! A three-node cluster runs the real role controller on every node: the leader generation
//! (engine with the per-anchor production permit, broadcast, settlement, sequencer tasks)
//! and the follower generation (anchor-gated import, transaction forwarding). Tests publish
//! finalized leadership transitions directly into each node's `LeadershipSchedule`, standing
//! in for the receipt-authenticated `LeaderUpdated` observations of a real L1 subscriber,
//! and drive L1 consumption through deposit-queue injection.
