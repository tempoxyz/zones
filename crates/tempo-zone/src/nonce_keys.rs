//! Nonce key constants for zone sequencer L1 operations.
//!
//! Tempo's 2D nonce system allows each account to maintain independent nonce
//! counters ("lanes") keyed by a `U256` nonce key. Each sequencer operation
//! type uses a dedicated lane so that `submitBatch`, `processWithdrawal`, and
//! admin transactions can be submitted concurrently without nonce contention.
//!
//! Nonce management is handled by [`NonceKeyFiller`](tempo_alloy::fillers::NonceKeyFiller)
//! in the provider pipeline — callers only need to set `.nonce_key(KEY)` on
//! each contract call.
