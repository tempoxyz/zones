# Zone forced withdrawals

A forced withdrawal requests the full liquid balance of one token from a Zone
account through Tempo L1, without a user L2 transaction or outbox allowance.
It still requires live Zone execution and settlement; it is not an exit path
when the operators stop running.

This crate provides payload encoding, root-signature authorization, and hashing
helpers. Stateful execution lives in the Zone inbox and outbox precompiles.

## Flow

1. **Request on L1.** The account signs an authorization and encrypts it with
   the Zone's published encryption key. `ZonePortal.requestForcedExit` collects
   compensation from the fee payer, pays the portal admin (or parks the
   payment as a claimable refund if the admin can't receive it), and appends
   the request to the shared inbox. The fee payer may differ from the account.
2. **Execute on the Zone.** The inbox verifies the decryption witness, decrypts
   the request, and checks authorization, the admission deadline, replay, and
   applicable policies. A successful request burns the account's full liquid
   balance at execution time and creates an ordinary withdrawal. Rejected and
   empty requests advance the inbox without a withdrawal; fatal execution
   errors roll back the transition.
3. **Settle on L1.** The sequencer submits the inbox progress and ordinary
   withdrawal commitments through the existing quorum-attested batch path.
   There is no separate forced-withdrawal outcome array or public rejection
   status.
4. **Deliver or recover.** Ordinary withdrawal processing pays the L1 recipient.
   Failed delivery queues a bounce-back to the debited Zone account, using the
   existing pending-credit recovery path if policy prevents an immediate mint.
   Admission compensation is not refunded.

## Activation

Forced exits require a coordinated Tempo hard fork that installs the forced-exit
portal runtime. Historical portal runtimes remain in use before that fork and do
not support forced requests. After the fork, each portal's `forcedExitVersion`
storage value starts at 0 and `requestForcedExit` reverts with
`ForcedExitsNotActivated`. The portal admin enables admission by calling
`activateForcedExits()`, which irreversibly sets `forcedExitVersion` to 1 and emits
`ForcedExitsActivated`.

Zone execution accepts a forced request only when the Zone block runs under the
forced-exit fork and the portal's `forcedExitVersion` is 1 at the imported Tempo
block. The admin must activate only after the Zone node and prover are upgraded;
an older node cannot track forced entries in the deposit queue and stalls on the
first one.

## Status and usage

Production admission remains disabled until the coordinated hard fork is live and
the portal admin activates it. Native end-to-end tests use an explicitly activated
test portal.
The current L1 `Verifier` is a stub; execution-proof enforcement is not provided
by this implementation.

`cargo run -p tempo-xtask -- forced-withdraw --help` describes the client command.
It needs only L1 RPC. Its optional `--wait-for-processing` confirms settled inbox
progress, not successful payout.

By default, the authorizing account also pays the L1 admission fee, exposing its
address as the public fee payer. Use `--fee-payer-private-key` for a separate payer
to reduce that linkage. This does not guarantee anonymity: `--to` also defaults
to the authorizing account, and L1 delivery reveals the recipient and amount.
