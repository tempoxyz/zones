# Checker design

The checker maintains an independent, durable accounting model for one Zone.
Authenticated protocol events advance this **ghost state**; exact Zone and
Tempo state reads verify it after every canonical Zone block.

```text
previous ghost state
        +
authenticated Tempo and Zone events
        ↓
candidate ghost state
        ↓
exact Zone balances and supply + exact Tempo Portal custody
        ↓
persist or record divergence
```

## Ghost state

The checker stores an expected balance for each known `(token, account)` and
five aggregate liability buckets per token:

| Bucket | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `account_total` | Sum of circulating Zone account entitlements |
| `pending_deposits` | Custody received on Tempo but not resolved on the Zone |
| `pending_withdrawals` | Burned on the Zone but not resolved on Tempo |
| `pending_tempo_refunds` | Deposit refunds parked on Tempo |
| `pending_zone_refunds` | Withdrawal bounce-backs returning to or parked on the Zone |

Protocol activity moves value between these buckets:

| Activity | Ghost transition |
| --- | --- |
| Tempo deposit | Increase pending deposits |
| Zone deposit mint | Credit recipient; decrease pending deposits |
| Zone transfer | Debit sender and credit recipient |
| Zone withdrawal | Debit sender; increase pending withdrawals |
| Tempo withdrawal | Decrease pending withdrawals |
| Tempo deposit refund | Move value from pending deposits to Tempo refunds |
| Zone withdrawal bounce-back | Move value from pending withdrawals to Zone refunds |
| Tempo refund claim | Settle the Tempo refund through a Portal transfer |
| Zone refund claim | Credit the Zone recipient and settle the Zone refund |

## Block verification

For each canonical Zone block, the checker:

1. Authenticates the imported Tempo blocks and decodes recognized events from
   canonical Zone receipts.
2. Converts recognized protocol events into ordered accounting effects.
3. Applies those effects to a copy of the last verified ghost state.
4. Reads the exact Zone post-state and imported Tempo state.
5. Persists the candidate state only when every invariant passes.

The candidate is discarded on failure, leaving the last verified state intact.

## Invariants

### Account balances

Every account named by a TIP-20 transfer in the block is checked:

```text
Zone balance(token, account) == ghost balance(token, account)
```

Untouched accounts remain in the durable ghost ledger but are not reread every
block.

### Token supply

Every enabled token is checked every block:

```text
Zone totalSupply(token) == ghost account_total(token)
ghost account_total(token) == sum of ghost account balances(token)
```

### Portal collateral

For every enabled token at the exact imported Tempo block:

```text
Portal custody >= account_total
                + pending_deposits
                + pending_withdrawals
                + pending_tempo_refunds
                + pending_zone_refunds
```

## Event authentication

Events drive the ghost model but are not accepted in isolation. The checker
also validates relationships between independent protocol evidence, including:

- Canonical Portal creation and token-enablement events are the only source of
  tracked-token membership; other accounting effects require existing members.
- Processed deposit outcomes and their exact TIP-20 mints.
- User withdrawal principal and fees and their exact receipt-local TIP-20
  debits and burns.

The checker does not independently compare L1 and L2 token-enablement calldata
or validate token metadata and Inbox/Outbox issuer roles. Those properties are
outside this accounting model.

It also does not correlate individual L1 deposits with L2 outcomes by deposit
hash or authenticate cross-layer withdrawal batch identity. Batch events are
strictly decoded but do not enter ghost state. Genesis bridge cursors are used
only to establish the empty bootstrap baseline.

For a sender-paid withdrawal, the sender's debit and burn must equal principal
plus fee. Sponsored withdrawals must instead contain an exact principal debit
from the sender and a separate exact fee debit from a nonzero payer. Deposit
bounce-backs are exempt because they do not debit a Zone user.

## Failure behavior

Transient acquisition failures retry without advancing the verified tip. A
deterministic mismatch records a durable divergence and freezes verification at
the preceding block. Observe mode never changes Zone execution or terminates
the node.
