//! Zone L2 block monitor with integrated batch submission.
//!
//! Watches the **Zone L2** chain for new blocks, collecting withdrawal events and
//! reading on-chain state to produce [`BatchData`]. Emits one L1 batch
//! submission for each L2 `BatchFinalized` boundary.
//!
//! ## Batch boundaries
//!
//! The payload builder records batch boundaries by appending
//! `ZoneOutbox.finalizeWithdrawalBatch` to final blocks only. The monitor treats
//! those `BatchFinalized` events as authoritative and emits exactly one
//! `submitBatch` per boundary, in order.
//!
//! ## EIP-2935 and ancestry mode
//!
//! The portal verifies `tempoBlockNumber` via EIP-2935, which stores the last 8192
//! block hashes. When `tempoBlockNumber` is within this window the batch submitter
//! uses **direct mode** (reading the hash straight from EIP-2935). If the zone
//! falls behind (e.g. sequencer downtime >2 hours), the submitter automatically
//! switches to **ancestry mode** for that batch: it supplies a recent L1 block
//! number that IS within the EIP-2935 window, and the proof must include a
//! block header chain linking that anchor back to `tempoBlockNumber`.
