//! Withdrawal collection store and L1 withdrawal processor for the zone sequencer.
//!
//! This module provides two main components:
//!
//! - [`WithdrawalStore`] — an in-memory store that holds [`abi::Withdrawal`] structs grouped by
//!   batch index. The L1 portal queue only stores hashes, so the sequencer must retain the actual
//!   withdrawal data to provide it when calling `processWithdrawals`.
//!
//! - [`WithdrawalProcessor`] — a background task that polls the ZonePortal withdrawal queue on
//!   **Tempo L1** and processes withdrawals by calling `processWithdrawals(withdrawals, remainingQueue)`.
//!
//! ## Data flow
//!
//! 1. Withdrawal requests originate on the **Zone L2** (`ZoneOutbox.requestWithdrawal`).
//! 2. The sequencer observes `WithdrawalRequested` events and stores the withdrawal data in the
//!    [`WithdrawalStore`].
//! 3. At batch finalization, the sequencer calls `finalizeWithdrawalBatch` on L2, which builds a
//!    hash chain. The proof then enqueues this hash chain into the portal's withdrawal queue on L1.
//! 4. The [`WithdrawalProcessor`] polls the portal queue on L1 and processes each withdrawal by
//!    providing the original data and the remaining queue hash.
//!
//! ## Batch-to-slot mapping
//!
//! The portal's withdrawal queue slots correspond to batch indices. The store's `batch_index`
//! should match the portal slot index. The caller (batch submitter) is responsible for tracking
//! which `batch_index` maps to which portal slot.
