# Private Zone RPC

Use this skill for private Tempo Zone JSON-RPC endpoints that require
`X-Authorization-Token`.

## Auth Model

Private zone RPC authenticates every request before method dispatch, including
public methods like `web3_clientVersion`.

The token header is:

```text
X-Authorization-Token: <hex token>
```

The token is:

```text
<signature><version:1><zoneId:4><chainId:8><issuedAt:8><expiresAt:8>
```

Build the signing digest as:

```text
keccak256("TempoZoneRPC" padded with zeros to 32 bytes || token fields)
```

Sign that digest with `cast wallet sign --no-hash`. Do not use Ethereum signed
message prefixing.

## Quick Call

For zones created by the current repo tooling, prefer the built-in token helper
because it reads generated metadata:

```bash
export PRIVATE_KEY=<zone-wallet-private-key>
TOKEN=$(just zone-auth-token my-zone)
cast rpc web3_clientVersion \
  --rpc-url https://private-zone-rpc.example.com \
  --rpc-headers "X-Authorization-Token: $TOKEN"
```

When only the endpoint tuple is known, set `PRIVATE_KEY` in the environment and
use the helper script for one-off calls:

```bash
.codex/skills/private-zone-rpc/scripts/private_rpc_call.sh \
  https://private-zone-rpc.example.com \
  71 \
  421700071 \
  web3_clientVersion
```

The helper prints the JSON-RPC body on success and keeps the token out of logs.

## Finding Zone ID And Chain ID

Prefer exact metadata:

1. Read `generated/<name>/zone.json` for `zoneId`.
2. Read `generated/<name>/genesis.json` for `.config.chainId`; `zone.json` may
   also mirror the same value as `chainId`.
3. Resolve the ZoneFactory address from `generated/<name>/zone.json`,
   `ZONE_FACTORY`, or the repo default. In this repo, the default lives
   in `xtask/src/zone_utils.rs` as `MODERATO_ZONE_FACTORY`, and `docs/ZONES.md`
   mirrors it.
4. For this repo, derive missing chain IDs with
   `zone_primitives::constants::zone_chain_id`:

```text
chain_id = 421700000 + (zone_id % 1002610000)
```

`xtask create-zone` writes this value, and the node validates it at startup
when `--zone.id` is nonzero.

Query the factory counter:

```bash
cast call "$ZONE_FACTORY" \
  'zoneCount()(uint32)' \
  --rpc-url https://rpc.moderato.tempo.xyz
```

`zoneCount()` returns created zones. The internal next-zone counter is
`zoneCount + 1`.

## Debugging Status Codes

- `401` with empty body usually means the auth header is missing or the header
  name is wrong.
- `403` with empty body means a token was present but failed validation:
  malformed signature, wrong `zoneId`, wrong `chainId`, expired token, or token
  validity window too large.
- If `X-Authorization-Token` gives `403` but `zone-auth-token` or
  `Authorization: Bearer` gives `401`, the endpoint is using the expected
  header name and the tuple/signature is wrong.
