# Admin commands

`tempo-xtask admin` contains one-off operational commands for deployed Tempo
Zones:

- `admin check`: read-only cluster health and consistency checks
- `admin leader set`: guarded `zone_setLeader` handoff
- `admin encryption-key prepare`: generate a replacement shared key and a
  two-key decryption file
- `admin encryption-key register`: verify preloading, simulate, and optionally
  submit `setSequencerEncryptionKey`

These commands do not manage secrets or deployments. The recovery runbook owns
secret-manager changes, rolling restarts, deposit tests, rollback decisions,
and removal of the old key after the Portal grace period.

## Configuration

Admin commands accept an optional TOML file containing public inputs:

```toml
[zone]
id = 1
# Optional. Relative paths are resolved from this file's directory.
manifest = "./zone-manifest.toml"

[l1]
rpc_url = "https://tempo-rpc.example"
# Optional. Defaults to the repository's Moderato ZoneFactory.
zone_factory = "0x..."
# Optional assertion against the ZoneFactory mapping.
portal = "0x..."

[[nodes]]
name = "leader"
operator_rpc_url = "http://leader.internal:8545"

[[nodes]]
name = "follower"
operator_rpc_url = "http://follower.internal:8545"
```

The same values can be passed with `--zone-id`, `--zone-manifest`,
`--l1-rpc-url`, `--zone-factory`, `--portal`, and repeated `--operator-rpc`
arguments. CLI values override the file. Supplying any `--operator-rpc`
arguments replaces the file's complete node list.

## Health checks and leader handoffs

```bash
tempo-xtask admin check --config zone-admin.toml

tempo-xtask admin check \
  --config zone-admin.toml \
  --wait-ready --node follower --timeout 5m

tempo-xtask admin leader set \
  --config zone-admin.toml \
  --target follower --via leader

# Repeat only after reviewing the dry run.
tempo-xtask admin leader set \
  --config zone-admin.toml \
  --target follower --via leader --execute
```

`admin check` compares a finalized ZonePortal snapshot with all configured
operator RPCs. It checks identity, loaded topology, membership, finalized
leader agreement, promotion readiness, active decryption-key availability,
canonical state, lag against both the newest Zone node and finalized L1, and
Zone progress. When a manifest is supplied, every manifest identity must be
queried exactly once. RPC-only nodes are excluded from checks that require
sequencer keys or promotion readiness.

`--wait-ready --node <name>` is the post-restart primitive. It waits for that
node to become reachable, canonical, and promotion-ready when applicable.

`admin leader set` is a dry run unless `--execute` is supplied. Its target must
differ from the current finalized Portal leader; choose a different,
promotion-ready follower. Use `--via` when more than one configured sequencer
can relay the request.

## Shared-key rotation

Prepare creates two owner-readable secret files:

```text
<rotation-dir>/
  new-shared.key
  deposit-decryption-keys
```

```bash
tempo-xtask admin encryption-key prepare \
  --config zone-admin.toml \
  --current-key-file /secure/current-shared.key \
  --existing-decryption-keys-file /secure/deployed/deposit-decryption-keys \
  --rotation-dir /secure/rotation
```

The command checks the cluster, verifies that the supplied current key matches
the finalized Portal key, and verifies that the deployed decryption-key file
contains that active key. It generates a distinct replacement and writes a
merged `deposit-decryption-keys` file containing every distinct deployed key
plus the replacement. It refuses to overwrite either output unless `--force`
is supplied.

Deploy the merged `deposit-decryption-keys` output, then roll all potential
leaders before running registration without `--execute`:

```bash
tempo-xtask admin encryption-key register \
  --config zone-admin.toml \
  --new-key-file /secure/rotation/new-shared.key \
  --transaction-key-file /secure/individual-sequencer.key
```

This is both the preload gate and the transaction dry run. It requires every
non-RPC-only sequencer to report both the current Portal key and replacement
key, checks cluster health and signer membership, and simulates the exact
Portal call.

Submit only after reviewing the dry run:

```bash
tempo-xtask admin encryption-key register \
  --config zone-admin.toml \
  --new-key-file /secure/rotation/new-shared.key \
  --transaction-key-file /secure/individual-sequencer.key \
  --execute
```

The execute path repeats all checks immediately before submission and waits
until the replacement is the finalized active Portal key. It is safe to retry
if that key is already active.

After registration, use the normal `tempo-xtask deposit` command for the
decryption test. Then update `--sequencer-key-file`, roll nodes follower-first,
run `admin check`, and send a second deposit. Retain every grace-valid or
draining decryption key in the deployed keyring. Retire a specific old key only
after its Portal expiry and the deposit queue have drained.
